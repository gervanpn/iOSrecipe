           recipe_instructions: "1: Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter. 2: Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper. 3: Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter. 4: Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge). 5: Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below). 6:Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.  Pro Tip: We prefer using a large cast-iron pan for best heat conduction, but a large heavy stainless steel pan will also work.",
